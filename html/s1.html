	<p> Rewrite the Star </p>
	<p>	by Zac Efron and Zendaya </p>
</div>

<div class="lyric">
<p>You know I want you <br>
It's not a secret I try to hide<br>
I know you want me <br>
So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied <br>
You claim it's not in the cards <br>
And fate is pullin' you miles away <br>
And out of reach from me <br>
But you're here in my heart <br>
So who can stop me if I decide <br>
That you're my destiny?</p>

<p>What if we rewrite the stars? <br>
Say you were made to be mine <br>
Nothing could keep us apart <br>
You'd be the one I was meant to find <br>
It's up to you, and it's up to me <br>
No one can say what we get to be <br>
So why don't we rewrite the stars? <br>
Maybe the world could be ours <br>
Tonight </p>

<p>You think it's easy <br>
You think I don't wanna run to you <br>
But there are mountains <br>
And there are doors that we can't walk through <br>
I know you're wondering why because we're able to be <br>
Just you and me within these walls <br>
But when we go outside, you're gonna wake up and see <br>
That it was hopeless after all</p>

<p>No one can rewrite the stars <br>
How can you say you'll be mine? <br>
Everything keeps us apart <br>
And I'm not the one you were meant to find <br>
It's not up to you <br>
It's not up to me <br>
When everyone tells us what we can be <br>
How can we rewrite the stars? <br>
Say that the world can be ours <br>
Tonight</p>

<p>All I want is to fly with you <br>
All I want is to fall with you <br>
So just give me all of you <br>
It feels impossible <br>
It's not impossible <br>
Is it impossible?<br>
Say that it's possible </p>

<p>How do we rewrite the stars? <br>
Say you were made to be mine? <br>
Nothing can keep us apart <br>
'Cause you are the one I was meant to find <br>			
It's up to you <br>
And it's up to me <br>
No one can say what we get to be <br>
And why don't we rewrite the stars? <br>
Changing the world to be ours </p>

<p>You know I want you <br>
It's not a secret I try to hide <br>
But I can't have you <br>
We're bound to break and my hands are tied.</p>
